An intranet that enables students to track the time spent on tasks and clients to see the progress of their projects at a milestone level.

## Tech stuff

The website is built using [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and basically nothing else. We used this since it's what we used in class and we didn't have much experience with any JavaScript frameworks at that point. As for the CSS framework, we used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for its examples and simplicity of use. However, having used Tailwind CSS in a later project, we would've prefered using that as it's more flexible.

For the backend, we are be using [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) since it's what we used in class, plus I already had a login system from a previous project.
